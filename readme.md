## About this repo

Here you'll find a copy of the popular word-guessing game Wordle, run entirely in the command line. It was made only for personal use, as a little exercise in Python programming. The wordlist I've used was originally sourced from [gwicks](http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm), but has been heavily modified by me to suit Wordle purposes.
